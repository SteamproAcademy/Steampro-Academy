# Replit Project Documentation

## Overview

This is a full-stack internal training platform for SteamPRO (a bath-tech startup) built with React, TypeScript, Express.js, and PostgreSQL using Drizzle ORM. The application provides a comprehensive learning management system with video-based training modules, quizzes, progress tracking, and certificate generation.

## User Preferences

Preferred communication style: Simple, everyday language.

## System Architecture

### Frontend Architecture
- **Framework**: React 18 with TypeScript
- **Routing**: Wouter for client-side routing
- **State Management**: React Query (@tanstack/react-query) for server state, localStorage for client-side persistence
- **UI Framework**: Tailwind CSS with shadcn/ui component library
- **Build Tool**: Vite with React plugin

### Backend Architecture
- **Runtime**: Node.js with Express.js
- **Language**: TypeScript with ES modules
- **Database ORM**: Drizzle ORM with PostgreSQL dialect
- **Database Provider**: Neon Database (@neondatabase/serverless)
- **Session Management**: In-memory storage with planned PostgreSQL session store (connect-pg-simple)

### Database Schema
- **Users Table**: Basic user authentication with id, username, and password fields
- **Database**: PostgreSQL with UUID primary keys
- **Migrations**: Managed through Drizzle Kit with schema located in `shared/schema.ts`

## Key Components

### Authentication System
- **Current Implementation**: Client-side authentication using hardcoded users in `client/src/data/users.ts`
- **Storage**: User sessions stored in localStorage
- **Users**: Predefined users with different departments (sales, ops, marketing, finance, manufacturing)

### Training Content Management
- **Content Structure**: Hierarchical training modules organized by tracks (Core, Departmental, HR)
- **Module Components**: Each module contains video content, reading materials, and quizzes
- **Content Storage**: Static data stored in `client/src/data/trainingData.ts`

### Progress Tracking
- **Storage**: localStorage-based progress tracking
- **Features**: Video completion, reading completion, quiz scores, module unlocking logic
- **Persistence**: All progress data maintained client-side

### UI Components
- **Design System**: shadcn/ui components with custom SteamPRO theming
- **Responsive Design**: Mobile-first approach with Tailwind CSS
- **Component Library**: Comprehensive set of reusable UI components

## Data Flow

### Authentication Flow
1. User enters credentials on login page
2. Credentials validated against hardcoded user data
3. Successful login stores user object in localStorage
4. Navigation component checks authentication state
5. Protected routes redirect to login if unauthenticated

### Learning Progress Flow
1. User selects training module from dashboard
2. Module unlocking logic checks prerequisites
3. Progress tracking updates localStorage on completion
4. Dashboard reflects updated progress and unlocks next modules
5. Certificate generation available after all tracks completed

### Content Delivery Flow
1. Static training data loaded from TypeScript modules
2. Video content embedded via YouTube iframes
3. Reading materials rendered as HTML content
4. Quiz interactions managed through React state
5. Progress updates persist to localStorage

## External Dependencies

### Core Dependencies
- **@neondatabase/serverless**: PostgreSQL database connection
- **drizzle-orm**: Database ORM and query builder
- **@tanstack/react-query**: Server state management
- **wouter**: Lightweight React router
- **@radix-ui/***: Headless UI component primitives

### UI Dependencies
- **tailwindcss**: Utility-first CSS framework
- **@radix-ui/react-***: Accessible component primitives
- **class-variance-authority**: CSS class variant management
- **clsx**: Conditional className utility

### Development Dependencies
- **vite**: Build tool and development server
- **tsx**: TypeScript execution engine
- **esbuild**: JavaScript bundler for production builds

## Deployment Strategy

### Development Environment
- **Local Development**: Vite dev server with HMR
- **Database**: Requires DATABASE_URL environment variable
- **Commands**: `npm run dev` for development mode

### Production Build
- **Frontend**: Vite builds static assets to `dist/public`
- **Backend**: esbuild bundles server code to `dist/index.js`
- **Commands**: `npm run build` for production build, `npm start` for production server

### Environment Configuration
- **Database**: PostgreSQL connection via DATABASE_URL
- **Session Storage**: Currently in-memory, scalable to PostgreSQL
- **Static Assets**: Served through Express in production

### Replit Integration
- **Development Plugins**: @replit/vite-plugin-runtime-error-modal and cartographer
- **Configuration**: Tailored for Replit development environment
- **Hot Reloading**: Full support for development workflow

The application follows a monorepo structure with clear separation between client, server, and shared code. The current implementation prioritizes rapid prototyping with client-side data storage, with infrastructure in place to migrate to full database persistence when needed.
